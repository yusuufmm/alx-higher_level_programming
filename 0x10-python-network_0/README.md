## Overview
Blast off into the realm of networking with this project! 🚀 Explore the intricacies of HTTP, cURL, URL parsing, request methods, response codes, headers, message bodies, cookies, and more. This mission involves crafting Bash and Python scripts that engage with web servers, dispatch HTTP requests, and decipher responses.

## Learning Objectives
- Decode the mysteries of a URL and its components. 🔍
- Navigate the HTTP protocol's request methods, response status codes, headers, and cookies. 🧭
- Become a cURL wizard, conjuring HTTP requests with ease. 🧙‍♂️
- Delve into the mechanics of entering a URL in a web browser. 🖥️

## Requirements
- Compatibility: All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. 🐧
- Bash Scripts: Must be 3 lines long, end with a new line, and be executable. 📜
- Python Files: Should be executable and use Python 3.8.5. 🐍
- Style: Adhere to PEP8 guidelines and include proper documentation. 📏
- Documentation: A comprehensive README.md file is mandatory. 📚
- Originality: Plagiarism is strictly prohibited. 🚫

## Project Files
1. `0-body_size.sh` - Displays the size of the body of an HTTP response.
2. `1-body.sh` - Shows the body of an HTTP response with a 200 status code.
3. `2-delete.sh` - Sends a DELETE request and displays the response body.
4. `3-methods.sh` - Lists all HTTP methods a server will accept.
5. `4-header.sh` - Sends a GET request with a custom header and shows the response body.
6. `5-post_params.sh` - Sends a POST request with parameters and displays the response body.
7. `100-status_code.sh` - Reveals only the status code of an HTTP response.
8. `101-post_json.sh` - Dispatches a JSON POST request and shows the response body.
9. `102-catch_me.sh` - Executes a request that elicits a specific server response.
10. `6-peak.py` - Contains a function to identify a peak in a list of unsorted integers.
11. `6-peak.txt` - Details the complexity analysis of the peak-finding algorithm.

## How to Use
- Bash scripts: Run with the necessary arguments.
- Python script: Execute and invoke the `find_peak` function with an integer list.
