## About

A brief introduction to the project, its purpose, and any relevant context.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- How to fetch internet resources with the Python package urllib
- How to decode urllib body response
- How to use the Python package requests #requestsiswaysimplerthanurllib
- How to make HTTP GET requests
- How to make HTTP POST/PUT/etc. requests
- How to fetch JSON resources
- How to manipulate data from an external service

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file at the root of the folder of this project is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- You must use get to access dictionary values by key (it won't throw an exception if the key doesn't exist)
- A documentation is not a simple word; it's a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)
- Your code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)
