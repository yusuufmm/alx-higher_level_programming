# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

## Overview
This project dives into the fascinating world of JavaScript, focusing on objects, scopes, closures, and more. It includes a series of tasks that progressively build your understanding of these concepts. Below are the tasks, their descriptions, and requirements.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Rectangle #0
**Description**: Write an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
**Requirements**: 
- Use the class notation for defining your class.

### Task 1: Rectangle #1
**Description**: Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with width (`w`) and height (`h`).
**Requirements**:
- Use the class notation for defining your class.
- The constructor must take 2 arguments `w` and `h`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`.

### Task 2: Rectangle #2
**Description**: Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with width (`w`) and height (`h`). Handle cases where `w` or `h` are not positive integers.
**Requirements**:
- Use the class notation for defining your class.
- The constructor must take 2 arguments `w` and `h`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`.
- If `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.

### Task 3: Rectangle #3
**Description**: Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with width (`w`) and height (`h`). Implement an instance method called `print()` to print the rectangle.
**Requirements**:
- Use the class notation for defining your class.
- The constructor must take 2 arguments: `w` and `h`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`.
- If `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
- Create an instance method called `print()` that prints the rectangle using the character 'X'.

### Task 4: Rectangle #4
**Description**: Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with width (`w`) and height (`h`). Implement methods: `print()`, `rotate()`, and `double()`.
**Requirements**:
- Use the class notation for defining your class.
- The constructor must take 2 arguments: `w` and `h`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`.
- If `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
- Create an instance method called `print()` that prints the rectangle using the character 'X'.
- Create an instance method called `rotate()` that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle.
- Create an instance method called `double()` that multiplies the width and the height of the rectangle by 2.

### Task 5: Square #0
**Description**: Write a class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from `Rectangle` of `4-rectangle.js`.
**Requirements**:
- Use the class notation for defining your class and `extends`.
- The constructor must take 1 argument: `size`.
- The constructor of `Rectangle` must be called (by using `super()`).

### Task 6: Square #1
**Description**: Write a class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from `Square` of `5-square.js`. Implement an instance method called `charPrint(c)` to print the square.
**Requirements**:
- Use the class notation for defining your class and `extends`.
- Create an instance method called `charPrint(c)` that prints the square using the character `c`. If `c` is undefined, use the character 'X'.

### Task 7: Occurrences
**Description**: Write a function `nbOccurences` that returns the number of occurrences of an element in a list.
**Requirements**:
- Prototype: `exports.nbOccurences = function (list, searchElement)`.

### Task 8: Esrever
**Description**: Write a function `esrever` that returns the reversed version of a list without using the built-in `reverse` method.
**Requirements**:
- Prototype: `exports.esre
