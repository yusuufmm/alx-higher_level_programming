# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

## Introduction
Welcome to the JavaScript warm-up project! This project is designed to help you get familiar with JavaScript by covering fundamental concepts. JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for both scripting and web development. In this project, we will focus on scripting tasks.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you'll learn:

- Why JavaScript programming is amazing.
- How to run a JavaScript script.
- How to create variables and constants.
- The differences between var, const, and let.
- The data types available in JavaScript.
- How to use control flow statements (if, if...else).
- How to use comments.
- How to manipulate variables using arithmetic operators.
- How to define functions and understand their return values.
- The scope of variables.
- How to import external files.
- Writing semistandard-compliant code.

## Requirements
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Your code should be semistandard compliant (version 16.x.x), following the rules of Standard with semicolons.
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

## Tasks Overview
1. **First constant, first print**
   - Create a constant variable `myVar` with the value "JavaScript is amazing" and print it using `console.log`.

2. **3 languages**
   - Print three lines: "C is fun," "Python is cool," and "JavaScript is amazing" using `console.log`.

3. **Arguments**
   - Print a message depending on the number of arguments passed: "No argument," "Argument found," or "Arguments found."

4. **Value of my argument**
   - Print the first argument passed to the script or "No argument" if none is passed.

5. **Create a sentence**
   - Print two arguments passed to the script in the format "arg1 is arg2" or "arg1 is undefined" if one or both arguments are missing.

6. **An Integer**
   - Print "My number: <argument converted to integer>" or "Not a number" if the argument cannot be converted to an integer.

7. **Loop to languages**
   - Print "C is fun," "Python is cool," and "JavaScript is amazing" using a loop and an array of strings.

8. **I love C**
   - Print "C is fun" x times, where x is the first argument passed to the script. If x cannot be converted to an integer, print "Missing number of occurrences."

9. **Square**
   - Print a square made of 'X' characters. The size of the square is determined by the first argument. Print "Missing size" if the argument cannot be converted to an integer.

10. **Add**
    - Define a function `add(a, b)` and print the addition of two integers passed as arguments. If one or both arguments are missing, print "NaN."

11. **Factorial**
    - Define a function that computes and prints the factorial of an integer argument. The factorial of NaN is 1. Use recursion.

12. **Second biggest!**
    - Find and print the second biggest integer from a list of arguments. If no argument is passed, print 0. If there's only one argument, print 0.

13. **Object**
    - Modify an object to replace the value 12 with 89.

14. **Add file**
    - Write a function that returns the addition of 2 integers. The function must be visible from outside.

15. **Call me Moby**
    - Write a function that executes a function x times.

16. **Add me maybe**
    - Write a function that increments and calls another function.

17. **Increment object**
    - Update an object by adding a new function `incr` that increments the integer value.

## Requirements
- Your code should be semistandard compliant.
- All your files must be executable.
